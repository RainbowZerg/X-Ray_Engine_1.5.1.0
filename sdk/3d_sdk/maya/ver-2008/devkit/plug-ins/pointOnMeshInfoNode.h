// PLUGIN NAME: pointOnMeshInfo v1.0

// FILE: pointOnMeshInfoNode.h

// DESCRIPTION: -Class declaration for "pointOnMeshInfo" node.

//              -Please see readme.txt for full details.

// AUTHOR: QT

// REFERENCES: -This plugin is based off of the `pointOnSurface` MEL command and "pointOnSurfaceInfo" node.

//             -The pointOnSubdNode.cpp plugin example from the Maya API Devkit was also used for reference.

//             -The MEL script AEpointOnSurfaceInfoTemplate.mel was referred to for the AE template MEL script

//              that accompanies the pointOnMeshInfo node.

// LAST UPDATED: Oct. 11th, 2001.

// COMPILED AND TESTED ON: Maya 4.0 on Windows
