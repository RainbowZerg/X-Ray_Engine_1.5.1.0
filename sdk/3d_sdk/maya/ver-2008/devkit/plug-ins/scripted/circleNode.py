#
# Example Plugin: circleNode.py
#
# This plug-in is an example of a user-defined dependency graph node.
# It takes a number as input (such as time) and generates two output
# numbers one which describes a sine curve as the input varies and
# one that generates a cosine curve. If these two are hooked up to
# the x and z translation attributes of an object the object will describe
# move through a circle in the xz plane as time is changed.
#
# See circleNodeTest.py for an example of how to use the node. The script will
# create a new "Circle" menu with a single item. Selecting this will build
# a simple model (a sphere which follows a circular path) which can be played back,
# by clicking on the "play" icon on the time slider.  Note: the circleNode
# plugin needs to be loaded before the "Circle" menu item can be executed
# properly.
#
# The node has two additional attributes which can be changed to affect
# the animation, "scale" which defines the size of the circular path, and
# "frames" which defines the number of frames required for a complete circuit
# of the path. Either of these can be hooked up to other nodes, or can
# be simply set via the command "maya.cmds.setAttr" operating on the circle node
# "circleNode1" created by the Python script. For example:
#
#	import maya.cmds as cmds
#	cmds.setAttr("circleNode1.scale", #)
#
# will change the size of the circle and:
#
#	cmds.setAttr("circleNode1.frames", #)
#
# will cause objects to complete a circle in indicated number of frames.
