#	Running this application will start a Maya standalone python application.
#
# Usage:
#
#	Set the environment variable MAYA_LOCATION to your Maya path and in 
#	a shell on Linux execute:

# 	with Maya for this to work.  This executable may be located
#	in a different directory for other platforms.
