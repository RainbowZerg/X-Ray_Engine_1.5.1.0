Editable Mesh project

It is important that any changes in the Editable Mesh source,
contained in this directory, are accompanied by parallel changes in
the Edit Mesh source, contained in ..\modifier.

I've done what I can to make the source as straightforwardly parallel
as possible for Shiva (Max version 3).  Please try to maintain this
parallel structure in the code as well as the UI.
