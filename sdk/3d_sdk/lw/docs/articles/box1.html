    <h3>Let's Make a Box</h3>
    <p><small><strong>Author</strong>&nbsp; Ernie Wright<br>
    <strong>Date</strong>&nbsp; 29 May 2001</small></p>
    <p>This is an introductory level plug-in tutorial. We'll be discussing a Modeler plug-in
    that makes a box. The emphasis in this first installment is on the basic mechanics of
    writing and compiling a plug-in. We don't want to get bogged down in the specifics of
    creating geometry, so we'll make a simple shape, and we'll do it in the simplest available
    way, using the <tt>MAKEBOX</tt> command. But don't worry, we'll get to some of the cool
    stuff in later installments.</p>
    <p><strong>Our First Box Plug-in</strong></p>
    <p>Here's the entire source file for our first plug-in. This is included in the SDK
    samples as the file <tt>sample/boxes/box1/<a href="../../sample/boxes/box1/box.c">box.c</a></tt>.</p>
    <pre>   #include &lt;lwserver.h&gt;
   #include &lt;lwcmdseq.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   XCALL_( int )
   Activate( long version, GlobalFunc *global, LWModCommand *local,
      void *serverData)
   {
      char cmd[ 128 ];

      if ( version != LWMODCOMMAND_VERSION )
         return AFUNC_BADVERSION;
      sprintf( cmd, &quot;MAKEBOX &lt;%g %g %g&gt; &lt;%g %g %g&gt; &lt;%d %d %d&gt;&quot;,
         -0.5, -0.5, -0.5,  0.5, 0.5, 0.5,  1, 1, 1 );
      local-&gt;evaluate( local-&gt;data, cmd );
      return AFUNC_OK;
   }

   ServerRecord ServerDesc[] = {
      { LWMODCOMMAND_CLASS, &quot;Tutorial_Box1&quot;, Activate },
      { NULL }
   };</pre>
    <p><strong>A Closer Look</strong></p>
    <p>Let's break this down and examine the parts in detail.</p>
    <pre>   #include &lt;lwserver.h&gt;
   #include &lt;lwcmdseq.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</pre>
    <p>These are the headers required by the plug-in. The first two, <em>lwserver.h</em> and <em>lwcmdseq.h</em>,
    are part of the LightWave SDK, in the <a href="../../include/">include</a> directory. <em>lwserver.h</em>
    contains definitions required by every plug-in. These are explained on the <a
    href="../server.html">Common Elements</a> page of the SDK, but I'll repeat some of that
    information less formally here. The second SDK header, <em>lwcmdseq.h</em>, contains the
    structure definitions and function prototypes comprising the CommandSequence plug-in
    class.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Classes</strong>: LightWave plug-ins are divided into different types, called
      classes. Each class does something different, or plugs into LightWave in a different
      place. The three Modeler classes are called <a href="../classes/cs.html">CommandSequence</a>
      (the kind we're looking at now), <a href="../classes/me.html">MeshDataEdit</a> and <a
      href="../classes/metool.html">MeshEditTool</a>. The CommandSequence class drives Modeler
      by issuing commands.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We also include the C standard header <em>stdio.h</em> to get the function prototype
    for <tt>sprintf</tt>, which we'll use to build the command string.</p>
    <p>The order in which these are listed, meaning whether the C headers or the LightWave SDK
    headers come first, usually doesn't matter. I put the SDK headers inside angle brackets (<tt>&lt;</tt>
    and <tt>&gt;</tt>), which tells the compiler to look for them in the &quot;usual
    place.&quot; Most compilers allow you to add directories to the search path for this usual
    place, and I use this to add the path to the SDK's include directory.</p>
    <pre>   XCALL_( int )
   Activate( long version, GlobalFunc *global, LWModCommand *local,
      void *serverData )
   {</pre>
    <p>This is the activation function, which happens to be the only function in our plug-in.
    Modeler will call this function when the user starts our plug-in. The actions of the
    plug-in are complete when this function returns.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Activation Function</strong>: Every plug-in has one. This is the entry point of
      a plug-in, sort of like <tt>main</tt> in a standard C program. Activation functions have a
      standard list of four arguments. The type of the third one depends on the plug-in class,
      but the others are always the same. The function doesn't have to be called <tt>Activate</tt>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The <tt>XCALL_</tt> macro is defined in <em>lwserver.h</em>. It encloses the return
    type of the function. <tt>XCALL_</tt> is a placeholder for any platform-specific or
    compiler-specific weirdness that might be required to get the calling conventions right.
    If you've programmed Microsoft Windows, you know that Win32 defines several macros (<tt>WINAPI</tt>
    and <tt>CALLBACK</tt>, for example) that serve a similar purpose.</p>
    <p>Strictly speaking, <tt>XCALL_</tt> should be used on every function in your source code
    that can be called by LightWave. But as of this writing, <tt>XCALL_</tt> has no effect on
    any platform LightWave currently supports, and you might notice that I've gotten somewhat
    careless in the SDK samples about using it for some callbacks. Just be aware that it might
    be needed in the future.</p>
    <p>For Modeler command plug-ins, the third argument to the activation function is a
    pointer to an LWModCommand structure, which is defined in <em>lwcmdseq.h</em>.</p>
    <pre>      char cmd[ 128 ];</pre>
    <p>Plug-ins can declare data in all the ways any other C program or library can. This is
    the string in which we'll build our command.</p>
    <pre>      if ( version != LWMODCOMMAND_VERSION )
         return AFUNC_BADVERSION;</pre>
    <p>The first thing an activation function should do is ensure that the version is correct.
    As LightWave and the SDK develop over time, the definition of LWModCommand can change. The
    version number passed to your activation function tells you, among other things, which
    version of LWModCommand Modeler is passing to you.</p>
    <p>The headers define symbols for the version number of each class's local data. This is
    the version that matches the definition in the header. In other words, the version of
    LWModCommand in <em>lwcmdseq.h</em> is <tt>LWMODCOMMAND_VERSION</tt>. If you recompile
    your plug-in with newer headers, LWModCommand might be different, and if it is, <tt>LWMODCOMMAND_VERSION</tt>
    will be also.</p>
    <p>LightWave tries to be backward-compatible with older plug-ins. It will call your
    activation function with different versions of the local data until you accept one of the
    versions (by not returning <tt>AFUNC_BADVERSION</tt>) or until it runs out of versions to
    try. With a couple of exceptions, it will start with the highest version first, so that
    you'll run with the highest version of the API you accept. For more about this, see the <a
    href="../compat.html">Compatibility</a> page.</p>
    <pre>      sprintf( cmd, &quot;MAKEBOX &lt;%g %g %g&gt; &lt;%g %g %g&gt; &lt;%d %d %d&gt;&quot;,
         -0.5, -0.5, -0.5,  0.5, 0.5, 0.5,  1, 1, 1 );
      local-&gt;evaluate( local-&gt;data, cmd );</pre>
    <p>This is where something actually happens. We build a command string containing the
    command and its arguments, then call the LWModCommand <tt>evaluate</tt> function to issue
    the command.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Function Pointers</strong>: These may be new to you. The plug-in API makes
      extensive use of them as a means of allowing separate modules (in this case Modeler and
      the plug-in) to call each other's functions.</p>
      <p>A pointer to a function can be used like pointers to anything else. They can appear in
      arguments, arrays and structures. When you dereference a function pointer, you're calling
      the function. The <tt>evaluate</tt> member of the LWModCommand structure is a pointer to a
      function that takes two arguments and returns an int.</p>
      <p>A call to a function through a pointer is sometimes written with an explicit
      dereference operator, like this.</p>
      <pre>   result = ( *local-&gt;evaluate )( local-&gt;data, cmd );</pre>
      <p>The parentheses are necessary to ensure that the <tt>*</tt> binds to the function
      pointer. The result of writing the call this way is exactly equivalent to writing it
      without the <tt>*</tt>, but it may clarify what's going on for human readers, and in rare
      cases it can prevent the C preprocessor from making incorrect macro substitutions.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The first argument to <tt>evaluate</tt> is the <tt>data</tt> field of the LWModCommand
    structure. <tt>data</tt> is an opaque pointer, meaning you're not supposed to know what it
    points to. This is data owned by Modeler, that Modeler uses to keep track of what it's
    doing. The second argument is the <tt>MAKEBOX</tt> command string.</p>
    <p>The <tt>MAKEBOX</tt> command is described on the Modeler <a
    href="../commands/modeler.html">Commands</a> page. It takes two required arguments, the
    coordinates of the low and high corners, and one optional argument, the number of segments
    along each axis. Each of these arguments is a vector, a triple of three numbers, delimited
    by angle brackets (<tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt>).</p>
    <p>Since we're making a cube centered on the origin, all three numbers in each vector are
    the same. We could simplify the command string somewhat by writing only the first value in
    each vector. And since the values are constants, we don't need <tt>sprintf</tt> at all. We
    could have written instead,</p>
    <pre>   local-&gt;evaluate( local-&gt;data, &quot;MAKEBOX &lt;-.5&gt; &lt;.5&gt; &lt;1&gt;&quot; );</pre>
    <p>When vector components are omitted, their values are taken from the last one included.</p>
    <pre>      return AFUNC_OK;
   }</pre>
    <p>The activation function returns <tt>AFUNC_OK</tt> to indicate that it completed
    successfully.</p>
    <p>The LWModCommand <tt>evaluate</tt> function returns 0 to indicate success, or a
    non-zero error code if something went wrong. For our simple plug-in, we're ignoring <tt>evaluate</tt>'s
    return value, but in non-trivial code, you'll probably want to react to errors, and this
    might involve returning something other than <tt>AFUNC_OK</tt> from your activation
    function.</p>
    <pre>   ServerRecord ServerDesc[] = {
      { LWMODCOMMAND_CLASS, &quot;Tutorial_Box1&quot;, Activate },
      { NULL }
   };</pre>
    <p>The ServerRecord array lists the plug-ins contained in a plug-in (.p) file. Our source
    code defines only one plug-in. Its class is <tt>LWMODCOMMAND_CLASS</tt>, its server name
    is &quot;Tutorial_Box1&quot; and its activation function is <tt>Activate</tt>. Although we
    don't use it here, the ServerRecord also allows you to specify a user name that differs
    from the server name, along with other information about the plug-in supplied as an array
    of tags.</p>
    <p>On each platform LightWave supports, the operating system provides a standard method of
    loading the .p file as a shared or dynamically-linked library and of obtaining the address
    within the library of the ServerRecord array. On Windows, for example, LightWave uses the
    Win32 <tt>LoadLibrary</tt> and <tt>GetProcAddress</tt> functions. Once LightWave has the
    address of the ServerRecord array, it can read the list of plug-ins in the file and find
    the activation functions.</p>
    <p><strong>Building the Plug-in</strong></p>
    <p>The <a href="../compile.html">Compiling</a> page of the SDK gives detailed instructions
    for creating a .p file from your C source code. But the instructions there can be a little
    bewildering if your experience with setting compiler switches and building DLLs or shared
    libraries is limited. So I thought I'd show you how I build plug-ins on my own machine
    with the compiler I'm using, Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0 Standard.</p>
    <p>This obviously won't be so helpful for people using different compilers and platforms,
    but hopefully it will at least demystify the process a little for them and demonstrate
    that no rocket science is involved.</p>

        Insert your source files into the project. You also need to insert a small amount of code
        from the SDK.<p>The <a href="../compile.html">Compiling</a> page tells you how to build
        the SDK code into a library called <em>server.lib</em>, and if you've done that already,
        you can just insert <em>server.lib</em> here. Or you can add <em>server.lib</em> to the
        library files listed on the Link tab of the Settings dialog. The effect is the same.</p>
        <p>But if you haven't built <em>server.lib</em>, you can instead insert the SDK files <em>startup.c</em>
        and <em>shutdown.c</em> from the <em>source</em> directory. The advantage of this approach
        is that you get both debug and release builds of the SDK code without having to worry
        about keeping track of two versions of <em>server.lib</em>.</p>
        <p>Either way, you'll also need to insert <em>servmain.c</em> and <em>serv.def</em>. The
        sole purpose of the .def file is to tell the linker to export the symbol <tt>_mod_descrip</tt>.,
        which is defined in servmain.c. <tt>_mod_descrip</tt> contains your ServerDesc array,
        among other things, and exporting it makes it visible to other programs like LightWave
        that call the Win32 <tt>GetProcAddress</tt> function.</p>
        <p>Once you've gotten all your sources into your project, you're ready for the compile and
        link settings that will turn it into a .p file. Open the settings dialog.</td>

    <p>We're only concerned here with settings on three of the tabs: the Debug, C/C++ and Link
    tabs. The information you enter on the Debug tab allows you to debug your plug-in using
    the windowed debugger in MSVC. You can set breakpoints in your code, step through it line
    by line, and examine the values of variables.</p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td width="600" align="center" valign="top"><img src="boximage/setdebug.gif" width="537"

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>In the edit field labelled &quot;Executable for debug session:&quot;, you'll enter the
    path to your installation of either Layout (Lightwav.exe) or Modeler (Modeler.exe),
    depending on which part of LightWave your plug-in is intended to run in. Our box plug-in
    runs in Modeler.</p>
    <p>The &quot;Working directory:&quot; will typically be the same as the &quot;Start
    in:&quot; directory for your LightWave installation. To find that, look on the Shortcut
    tab of the Properties panel for the icon or the Startup Menu entry that launches LightWave
    on your system. Also look there for the program arguments you normally use. I usually set
    mine to run without the Hub and to write the config files in the directory where the
    program files are.</p>
    <p>You might also want to add the -d switch, which runs the LightWave component in a
    &quot;debug&quot; mode. In this mode, plug-in files are always closed and detached when
    not in use, making it possible to recompile them while LightWave remains open. LightWave
    may also create a text file error dump when certain plug-in related problems occur.</p>

    <p>Like a lot of compilers, MSVC gives you the option of precompiling the headers, and it
    does this by default. The headers for a project tend not to change as often as the C
    sources, so in theory this can save a small amount of time, especially when you're
    including the Win32 headers and compiling on a slow machine. But the .pch files MSVC
    creates can be surprisingly large, over a megabyte for the Win32 headers, and these are
    created redundantly for each project. And they don't really save that much time. So I
    always turn this option off.</p>
    <p>I also turn off incremental linking, mostly for similar reasons, but also to avoid the
    small chance that it will introduce errors by failing to rebuild code affected by changes
    elsewhere in the project.</p>

    </table>
    <p>On the C/C++ tab, under Preprocessor, add <tt>_X86_</tt> and <tt>_WIN32</tt> to the
    preprocessor definitions. The SDK source and the <em>lwdisplay.h</em> header use these
    symbols to select platform-specific code. In the &quot;Additional include
    directories:&quot; field, enter the path to the SDK include directory.</p>

    </table>
    <p>The last settings step is renaming the output file so that it has a .p extension. This
    isn't strictly necessary. You can rename the file later, or simply use it with its default
    .dll extension, which LightWave has no problem with. If you do rename the file here, make
    sure only one of the two builds is selected in the left pane before altering the filename.
    If both are selected, the debug and release builds will have the same name and will
    overwrite each other.</p>
    <p>You're now ready to build. By default, the toolbar includes a dropdown list from which
    you can select the debug or release builds of your project. During development, you'll
    usually want to be building and testing the debug version. Once you've chosen the build,
    select &quot;Build box1.p&quot; (Shift + F8) or &quot;Rebuild All&quot; (Alt + F8) from
    the Build menu, or hit the little build icon on the toolbar.</p>
    <p>To run the plug-in, hit &quot;Execute Modeler.exe&quot; in the same menu. If this is
    the first time you've run the plug-in, you'll need to install it in LightWave. Use the Add
    Plug-ins option (in the Modeler/Plug-ins or Layout/Plug-ins menu) and in the file dialog,
    navigate to the .p file you created. Unless you changed the path, your .p file will be in
    the Debug directory created by MSVC in your project directory.</p>
    <p>To debug your plug-in, select one of the Debug submenu options, typically Go. MSVC will
    warn you that the LightWave component contains no debugging information. That's OK, since
    you're not debugging LightWave itself. The debug build of your plug-in does contain this
    information. Before hitting Debug/Go, you'll typically set one or more breakpoints, so
    that execution stops at those points and you can examine the state of the plug-in's data.
    Put the cursor in one of your source files in the MSVC editor and press F9 to set a
    breakpoint there.</p>
    <p><strong>What's Next</strong></p>
    <p>If all's gone well, you've learned how to write, compile and run a Modeler plug-in. In
    the <a href="box2.html">next installment</a>, we'll work on calling Modeler commands in a
    more sophisticated way, and we'll add a user interface.</td>
