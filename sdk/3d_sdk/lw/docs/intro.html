    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This is the documentation for the LightWave 3D Server Development Kit (SDK) for
    versions of LightWave beginning with 6.0. Although it will refer specifically to
    LightWave, other NewTek products may also support LightWave plug-ins. Documentation for
    versions prior to 6.0 and strategies for supporting multiple versions and products are
    discussed on the <a href="compat.html">compatibility</a> page.</p>
    <p>I'll refer to myself in the first person in this introduction, just so you know that
    the documentation was in fact written by a human being, but to give you fair warning, this
    is a technical reference with more than a few dry spots. It makes significant demands on
    the reader, and depending on your degree of familiarity with LightWave, the C language,
    and 3D graphics programming, many parts might be completely opaque the first time through.</p>
    <p>That's normal. Don't be discouraged by it. The information covered in this
    documentation is inherently difficult. It's not just you.</p>
    <p>Because of this, I've tried very hard to be clear, concise and accurate. I've built on
    the work of others whose knowledge of this material comes directly from writing the host
    side of the plug-in API (application programming interface), and some of those same people
    have made an effort to explain the difficult parts to me. I've corrected a number of
    mistakes pointed out by readers of earlier drafts, but inevitably, errors and omissions
    remain, and chances are you'll find at least one.</p>
    <p>In the following sections, I recommend books that provide the background you'll need,
    review a particular programming concept that may be unfamiliar to some, and give a quick
    tour of the plug-in system with links to important parts of the documentation. For
    developers with pre-6.0 plug-in experience, I'll also highlight some of the major changes
    that first appeared in LightWave 6.0.</p>

    <a name="prerequisites"><p><strong>Programming Prerequisites</strong></a> </p>
    <p>These pages document the C language interface to LightWave. They assume that you're
    comfortable with writing C code, so they won't teach you C. Specifically, they won't
    discuss abstract dynamic library concepts or the writing of re-entrant, thread-safe code.
    They also won't teach you 3D graphics programming or, for lack of a better term, the
    LightWave user paradigm. All of this information is available from other, better sources.</p>
    <p>My favorite book for learning C programming is<ul>
      <li>Al Kelley and Ira Pohl, <strong><em>A Book on C</em></strong>, 4th ed., Addison-Wesley,
        ISBN 0201183994</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You might also want a good algorithms book. I have<ul>
      <li>Robert Sedgewick, <em><strong>Algorithms in C</strong></em>, Addison-Wesley, ISBN
        0201514257</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3D graphics relies heavily on trigonometry and linear algebra, but in most cases you
    don't need an advanced knowledge of those subjects. You do need to know what sine, cosine
    and tangent are, and you need to know how to do vector and matrix arithmetic. Many of the
    books below include an appendix that reviews the basics. For greater depth, visit the
    nearest university bookstore and pick up whatever textbook they're using for the
    introductory courses.</p>
    <p>Any good introductory textbook on graphics programming should provide an adequate
    foundation for understanding the fundamental concepts of computer graphics. I like<ul>
      <li>F.S. Hill, <strong><em>Computer Graphics</em></strong>, Macmillan, ISBN 0023548606</li>
      <li>Alan Watt, <em><strong>Fundamentals of Three-Dimensional Computer Graphics</strong></em>,
        Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0201154420</li>
    </ul>
    <p>but there are others. Note that both of these are more than 10 years old. That's okay,
    though. The fundamentals really haven't changed much in that amount of time. For more
    advanced texts, the canon would include<ul>
      <li>Andrew Glassner (series ed.), <strong><em>Graphics Gems</em></strong>, vol. I - V,
        Academic Press, ISBNs 0122861663, 0120644819, 0124096735, 0123361559, 0125434553</li>
      <li>James Foley et al., <strong><em>Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice</em></strong>,
        2nd ed. in C, Addison-<wbr>Wesley, ISBN 0201848406</li>
      <li>Alan Watt and Mark Watt, <strong><em>Advanced Animation and Rendering Techniques: Theory
        and Practice</em></strong>, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0201544121</li>

        Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0201632748</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also consider the two compilation volumes of Jim Blinn's articles in <em>IEEE Computer
    Graphics and Applications</em> and the often ground-breaking papers in the annual ACM
    SIGGRAPH <em>Proceedings</em>. In addition to these, you'll also occasionally find
    chapters and articles specific to writing LightWave plug-ins in trade books and magazines,
    some of which are written by members of the LightWave programming team. Don't forget the
    LightWave user manual, the best source of information about how the program works. And, of
    course, you'll find supplementary material at every level of complexity on the Internet.</p>
    <p>But in the event none of this has failed to dissuade you from learning to program by
    writing LightWave plug-ins, I will review one programming concept that's fundamental to
    the way plug-ins work and which may not be easily understood solely by osmosis. If you
    already know what a callback is, feel free to <a href="#tour">skip ahead</a>.</p>
    <a name="callbacks"><p><em><strong>Function pointers</strong></em></a> </p>
    <p>LightWave plug-ins make extensive use of function pointers. For people of my
    programming generation who grew up on BASIC, FORTRAN and Pascal, function pointers seem a
    bit exotic at first glance. In a linear, self-contained program, there are relatively few
    reasons to use them. But function pointers are just another kind of variable, and they
    become quite useful when two separate modules need to execute each other's code.</p>
    <p>The type definition for a particular function pointer might look like this: </p>
    <pre>   typedef int ( *FooFunc )( int, double );</pre>
    <p>This says that FooFunc is a function that returns an int (note: not an int *) and takes
    an int and a double as arguments. Given this definition, you can now declare variables of
    type FooFunc *, </p>
    <pre>   FooFunc *foo;</pre>
    <p>You can write a FooFunc function, </p>
    <pre>   int myfoo( int count, double size );
   {
      return ( int )( size * count );
   }</pre>
    <p>and assign this to your FooFunc variable,</p>
    <pre>   foo = myfoo;</pre>
    <p>You can also pass FooFuncs as arguments to other functions.</p>
    <pre>   int bar( FooFunc *foo );</pre>
    <p>Equivalently, you can explicitly prototype the <tt>foo</tt> function in <tt>bar</tt>'s
    function header.</p>
    <pre>   int bar( int ( *foo )( int, double ));</pre>
    <p>The standard C runtime library contains at least two functions that take function
    pointers as arguments, <tt>bsearch</tt> and <tt>qsort</tt>, both usually prototyped in <tt>stdlib.h</tt>.
    The prototypes look something like this:</p>
    <pre>   void *bsearch( const void *key, const void *a, size_t n, size_t size,
      int ( *compar )( const void *, const void * ));
   void qsort( void *a, size_t n, size_t size,
      int ( *compar )( const void *, const void * ));</pre>
    <p>For both of these, you write the comparison function that ranks two elements from the
    array you're sorting or searching, and you pass this function as an argument to <tt>bsearch</tt>
    or <tt>qsort</tt>. You can sort or search almost anything using these functions, as long
    as you can write an appropriate comparison function.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Callbacks</strong></em></p>
    <p>The comparison function for <tt>bsearch</tt> and <tt>qsort</tt> is an example of a <em>callback</em>,
    a function you write for other modules to call. The C runtime calls your comparison
    function whenever it needs to rank two elements from your array.</p>
    <p>Callbacks are common in user interface code for modern windowed environments, where
    they're used to handle &quot;events&quot; triggered by user actions. LightWave's built-in
    user interface facility uses callbacks in exactly this way, but callbacks are also used
    elsewhere in the plug-in API. Layout handler class plug-ins contain callbacks that are
    called at certain points during rendering, and Modeler plug-ins use callbacks to enumerate
    the points and polygons of an object.</p>
    <p>You refer to callbacks, of course, by using function pointers.</p>
    <a name="tour"><p><strong>A Quick Tour</strong></a> </p>
    <p>This section is a brief, informal overview of the plug-in system and the way plug-ins
    work. It points to other areas of the documentation so that you know where the details are
    explained. You might also want to read through Part 1 of the <a href="articles/box1.html">Box
    tutorial</a> in the Articles section. It covers much of the same ground by a different
    route, taking you step by step through the creation of a simple plug-in.</p>
    <p>If you're a plug-in oldtimer from the days before LightWave 6.0 and you just want to
    get caught up, feel free to <a href="#new">skip ahead</a>.</p>
    <p>Plug-ins are dynamically linked libraries of code that extend LightWave's capabilities.
    LightWave ships with dozens of plug-ins, and the source code for many of these is included
    in the plug-in SDK.</p>
    <p>Plug-ins are divided into different types, called <a href="classes.html">classes</a>.
    These aren't actual C++ classes, although the idea is pretty much the same. The different
    classes plug into LightWave at different points and do different things. There are classes
    for<ul>
      <li>loading and saving images, movies, objects and scenes</li>
      <li>moving items and modifying parameter channels</li>
      <li>rendering surfaces, textures, volumes and environments</li>
      <li>image processing</li>
      <li>creating and manipulating geometry</li>
      <li>custom color picker and file dialogs</li>
      <li>displaying rendered output</li>
      <li>command-based scene alterations</li>
      <li>controlling other plug-ins, and</li>
      <li>providing services accessible to other plug-ins.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All plug-ins have access to functions that provide information or services. These are
    called <a href="globals.html">globals</a>, and they can be used to get item positions,
    object geometry, surface settings, camera parameters, system and locale information, and a
    lot of other data. Globals are also used to build platform-<wbr>independent user interfaces and
    to display common interface elements like file dialogs, color pickers, messages, and
    envelope and texture editors. You can even write your own globals.</p>
    <p>A few plug-in classes can also issue <a href="commands.html">commands</a>. Most
    commands parallel actions the user can take through the LightWave interface. While globals
    are used primarily to read parameters, commands are used to set them.</p>
    <p>More than half of the plug-in classes are <a href="handler.html">handler</a> classes.
    Unlike plug-ins that run when they're invoked and then exit, handlers have a persistent
    lifetime. They supply callbacks that LightWave can call at the appropriate time to perform
    their tasks. Most handlers are involved in rendering and are called at each frame to, for
    example, move objects, paint surfaces, or append the frame to a movie&nbsp; file. A few
    handlers respond to user interface events and manage interface objects.</p>
    <p>Handlers can be applied, or invoked, multiple times. An item motion handler, for
    example, can control the motion of several different items in a scene. Each invocation of
    a handler is called an <em>instance</em>, and for each instance, a handler will create
    some data that it uses to keep track of that instance. The instance data is normally where
    handlers hold user settings and precalculated parameters, but it can be anything useful to
    the handler.</p>
    <p>Handlers provide callbacks for loading and saving their instance data in scene and
    object files. The actual reading and writing of data in these files is accomplished
    through <a href="fileio.html">file I/O functions</a> provided by LightWave. A global
    allows plug-ins of any class to use these same functions with other files, which can be
    useful for creating and reading platform-independent configuration files for your plug-in,
    for example.</p>
    <p>The file I/O functions are one of several mechanisms shared by multiple classes with
    similar needs. Two more are the <a href="imageio.html">image I/O system</a> used by image
    and animation loaders and image savers, and the <a href="raytrace.html">raytracing
    functions</a> used by shaders, volume renderers and filters.</p>
    <p>Every plug-in has an <a href="server.html#actfunc">activation function</a>. This is the
    entry point for the plug-in, the function LightWave calls to begin the interaction between
    the program and your plug-in. For non-handlers, this is where all of the work of the
    plug-in is done, but for handlers, this is only where the plug-in tells LightWave how to
    find the plug-in's callbacks. The activation function has the same form for all plug-in
    classes, with a single argument that differs for each class.</p>
    <p>A plug-in file can contain more than one plug-in. Each file contains an array of <a
    href="server.html#servdesc">server records</a>, one for each plug-in in the file. The
    server record for a plug-in lists the name and the class of the plug-in and the address of
    the plug-in's activation function. The server record array is an external data structure,
    a data block in the file that the operating system can locate by name. When LightWave
    first loads a plug-in, it asks the operating system to return the address of the server
    record array, and then it finds in that array the addresses of the activation functions
    the file contains. It can later call the activation function and, for handlers, obtain the
    addresses of other functions in the file.</p>
    <p>Most plug-ins provide a user interface, and they normally display it as part of their
    activation function processing. Handler classes have associated <a href="handler.html#ui">interface</a>
    classes whose activation functions are dedicated to this purpose. You can build your
    interfaces using platform-specific elements, but the SDK provides a complete,
    platform-independent system for building interfaces with elements that have LightWave's
    look and feel. This system is described on the <a href="globals/panel.html">Panels</a> and
    <a href="globals/xpanel.html">XPanels</a> pages.</p>
    <p>So that you don't have to understand all of this all at once, start by trying to <a
    href="compile.html">compile</a> the example source that's included with the SDK. Once
    you're compiling successfully, you can experiment by altering the examples before moving
    on to creating your own plug-ins.</p>
    <a name="new"><p><strong>What's New</strong></a></p>
    <p>If you've written plug-ins for versions of LightWave prior to 6.0, much of the current
    API will seem familiar, but a lot has changed.</p>
    <p><em>Classes</em> - There are new classes for <a href="classes/animload.html">anim
    loading</a>, <a href="classes/channel.html">channels</a>, <a href="classes/custobj.html">custom
    nulls</a> in Layout, <a href="classes/environ.html">environment</a> (backdrop) rendering,
    multiple plug-in <a href="classes/master.html">mastering</a> in Layout, custom Modeler <a
    href="classes/metool.html">tools</a>, procedural <a href="classes/texture.html">textures</a>,
    and <a href="classes/volume.html">volumetrics</a>. Many of the other classes have been
    significantly enhanced, and nearly all of them have changed at least slightly to reflect
    the new architecture.</p>
    <p><em>Globals</em> - The number of globals has nearly doubled, and many of the familiar
    ones have grown substantially. Among the new globals are a number of user interface
    components, including the <a href="globals/xpanel.html">XPanels</a> alternative to classic
    panels, standard access to the current <a href="globals/colorpik.html">color picker</a>,
    and off-screen bitmaps that can be <a href="globals/raster.html">blitted</a> onto panels.
    A revamped <a href="globals/anenvel.html">envelopes</a> global is joined by related <a
    href="globals/chaninfo.html">channels</a> and <a href="globals/vparam.html">variant
    parameter</a> globals. Layout can tell you about the state of its <a
    href="globals/intinfo.html">interface</a>, and modified handler instances can <a
    href="globals/instupdt.html">update</a> Layout.</p>
    <p>Plug-ins can <a href="globals/imgutil.html">save images</a> through any installed image
    saver and use <a href="globals/fileio.html">file I/O</a> functions for creating and
    reading block-structured files. They can incorporate any of the installed procedural
    textures using globals for <a href="globals/txtrfunc.html">evaluating</a> them and for
    displaying a standard texture <a href="globals/txtred.html">editor</a> to the user.
    Globals are available to help with managing <a href="globals/shelf.html">presets</a> and
    displaying <a href="globals/preview.html">previews</a>. Layout now exposes detailed <a
    href="globals/sceneobj.html">geometry data</a> for every object in the scene and allows
    plug-ins to read and modify <a href="globals/surface.html">surface</a> settings and manage
    <a href="globals/particle.html">particle system</a> data.</p>
    <p><em>Handlers</em> - The local arguments to handler activation functions have changed. <tt>create</tt>,
    <tt>destroy</tt> and so on are still in there, but they've been reorganized and
    standardized. The interface activation functions associated with handlers now receive a
    structure rather than just their instance data, and many classes will be able to use this
    structure to draw their interface controls onto LightWave's own panels. Some handlers can
    now be run in Modeler to provide previews, and since the world looks different in Modeler,
    this case needs to be treated carefully.</p>
    <p><em>Other Changes</em> - The ServerRecord now includes an optional array of tag strings
    for each plug-in. Among other things, these tags allow you to list language-specific names
    for your plug-ins. If your plug-in supplies a list of names, the plug-in name LightWave
    displays to the user will depend on the locale of the user's system.</p>
    <p>The <tt>XCALL_INIT</tt> macro has been deprecated, meaning that it's no longer
    required. You can still use it, but it doesn't do anything on any currently supported
    platform and isn't likely to return in the future.</p>
    <p>All class name and global identifier strings have been assigned preprocessor symbols.
    For future compatibility, you should use these symbols, rather than the string literals,
    in ServerRecord references and calls to the <tt>global</tt> function.</p>
