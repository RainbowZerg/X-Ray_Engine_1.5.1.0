    <h3>Compatibility</h3>
    <p>This page discusses four different varieties of plug-in compatibility. <ul>
      <li><em>Backward</em> compatibility is the ability to use the same code, including the
        latest SDK headers and source, with both current and older versions of LightWave.</li>
      <li><em>Forward</em> compatibility deals with writing code that won't break in future
        versions of LightWave.</li>
      <li>Compatibility <em>across platforms</em> allows you to use one code base to support more
        than one operating system or CPU type. </li>
      <li><em>Product</em> compatibility means being able to use the same code in products that
        may be derived from LightWave or share some of its plug-in API (application programming
        interface).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of these, backward compatibility is likely to be the greatest concern. Forward
    compatibility and compatibility across platforms are largely automatic for the plug-in
    author, as long as he or she writes to the specification in this documentation and uses
    the facilities provided by the SDK rather than platform-specific code. The requirements
    for product compatibility are difficult to predict at the moment, since no concrete
    examples of the need for it exist yet, but globals for determining the product and version
    number are available, and we'll introduce them here.</p>
    <p>This discussion necessarily delves into some grubby details, so it'll be easier to
    follow if you're already familiar with the SDK. But if you're not, links to the
    information you need are provided.</p>
    <p><strong>SDK Versions</strong></p>
    <p>The plug-in SDK continues to evolve. Changes to it will appear with each release of
    LightWave. The SDK itself isn't versioned, however. Each class and global has its own
    version number. Your plug-in remains both forward and backward compatible with SDK changes
    by using, for <a href="classes.html">classes</a>, the version number passed as the first
    argument to your <a href="server.html#actfunc">activation function</a>, and for <a
    href="globals.html">globals</a>, increments embedded in the global's service name string.</p>
    <p>The SDK defines symbolic names for the versions of each class. The version number for <a
    href="classes/shader.html">shaders</a>, for example, is <tt>LWSHADER_VERSION</tt>, which
    as of this writing is defined as 4. Your shader's activation function will usually compare
    this to the version number passed as the first argument to the function and return <tt>AFUNC_BADVERSION</tt>
    if the two numbers don't match.</p>
    <pre>   XCALL_( int )
   MyActivate( long version, GlobalFunc *global, LWShaderHandler *local,
      void *serverData );
   {
      if ( version != LWSHADER_VERSION )
         return AFUNC_BADVERSION;</pre>
    <p>This ensures that the LWShaderHandler being passed to you in the <tt>local</tt>
    argument is the same as the LWShaderHandler in your copy of the <a
    href="../include/lwshader.h">lwshader.h</a> SDK header file. The <a
    href="../include/lwshader.h">lwshader.h</a> header contains the line</p>
    <pre>   #define LWSHADER_VERSION 4</pre>
    <p>as well as the definition of the structures used by shaders, including LWShaderHandler
    and LWShaderAccess. When you compile your plug-in using this header, the compiler renders
    the version checking code in your activation function as</p>
    <pre>   if ( version != 4 ) ...</pre>
    <p>You test for version 4 because that's the version of the shader API defined in your
    copy of the header, and the version of the shader-related structures compiled into your
    plug-in.</p>
    <p>LightWave will call your activation function with every version of LWShaderHandler it
    supports, until it runs out of versions or one of the calls succeeds. Forward
    compatibility is therefore automatic, as long as LightWave continues to support version 4
    of LWShaderHandler.</p>
    <p>But what happens when you update your copy of the SDK headers? <tt>LWSHADER_VERSION</tt>
    may have been incremented, yet you want to continue to support LightWave 6.x, which itself
    supports shaders no later than version 4.</p>
    <p>First, your activation function must accept a range of versions. LightWave starts by
    calling your activation function with the highest version it supports, then with
    successively lower versions. (The exception is the <a href="handler.html#ui">interface
    activation</a> for handlers, which for historical reasons starts at 1 and counts up.) Your
    plug-in is therefore activated with the highest version supported by both the plug-in and
    the LightWave it's running in.</p>
    <pre>   XCALL_( int )
   MyActivate( long version, GlobalFunc *global, LWShaderHandler *local,
      void *serverData );
   {
      if ( version &gt; LWSHADER_VERSION || version &lt; 4 )
         return AFUNC_BADVERSION;</pre>
    <p>Then you have to decide how to handle the different versions of LWShaderHandler and
    other shader-related structures in the rest of your code. In many cases, changes to the
    API of a class are incremental. Existing structure members are retained, and new members
    are appended, making it possible to use the most recent versions of the data structures
    with previous versions of the API. You just need to remember not to use new members when
    you've been activated with an older version number.</p>
    <p>The documentation includes a history of the changes made to the headers with each
    revision of LightWave. Look for this in both the <a href="60b.html">changes</a> lists and
    in sections labeled &quot;History&quot; on the pages for each class. Using this
    information, you can see how the current data structures differ from those in previous
    versions.</p>
    <p>Globals work in a similar way. The SDK headers define symbolic names for the strings
    you pass to the global function. <tt>LWMESSAGEFUNCS_GLOBAL</tt>, for example, is the
    symbolic name of the messages global.</p>
    <pre>   LWMessageFuncs *msgf;
   msgf = global( LWMESSAGEFUNCS_GLOBAL, GFUSE_TRANSIENT );
   if ( msgf ) { ...</pre>
    <p>By using the symbolic name, you ensure that the LWMessageFuncs structure returned by
    the global function is the same as the LWMessageFuncs defined in your copy of the <a
    href="../include/lwhost.h">lwhost.h</a> SDK header.</p>
    <p>The name strings underlying the symbols often contain trailing numbers or other
    incrementing characters. As of this writing, the string for the messages global, for
    example, is &quot;Info Messages 2&quot;. If the LWMessageFuncs structure changes in the
    future, the new string will most likely be &quot;Info Messages 3&quot;, but LightWave will
    continue to support &quot;Info Messages 2&quot;. Again, your plug-in's forward
    compatibility with future versions of LightWave is automatic.</p>
    <p>For backwards compatibility, you can request earlier versions of globals when the most
    recent version, or the version defined in your copy of the headers, isn't available. As
    with class-related structures, the data structures for globals in many cases evolve in
    backward-compatible ways. The LWMessageFuncs structure for the original &quot;Info
    Messages&quot; global looks like this.</p>
    <pre>   typedef struct st_LWMessageFuncs {
      void (*info)     (const char *, const char *);
      void (*error)    (const char *, const char *);
      void (*warning)  (const char *, const char *);
   } LWMessageFuncs;</pre>
    <p>The &quot;Info Messages 2&quot; global adds several functions to the end of the
    structure.</p>
    <pre>   typedef struct st_LWMessageFuncs {
      void (*info)     (const char *, const char *);
      void (*error)    (const char *, const char *);
      void (*warning)  (const char *, const char *);
      int  (*okCancel) (const char *ttl, const char *, const char *);
      int  (*yesNo)    (const char *ttl, const char *, const char *);
      int  (*yesNoCan) (const char *ttl, const char *, const char *);
      int  (*yesNoAll) (const char *ttl, const char *, const char *);
   } LWMessageFuncs;</pre>
    <p>The version 2 definition is backward-compatible with the pointer returned from a
    request for the original &quot;Info Messages&quot; global, as long as you remember not to
    use the fields added for &quot;Info Messages 2&quot;.</p>
    <p><strong>Before LightWave 6.0</strong></p>
    <p>The revision of the plug-in API for LightWave 6.0 was the most substantial since the
    plug-in architecture was first introduced in 1995. Prior to 6.0, API revisions were
    incremental and had very little effect on existing source code. New globals were made
    available, and new members were appended to existing class structures. Plug-in authors
    could take advantage of the new features without changing much of their code and without
    sacrificing backward compatibility with older versions of LightWave.</p>
    <p>This is also true within versions from 6.0 onward. But there is a great divide at 6.0,
    and the most difficult backward compatibility challenge involves bridging this divide.
    (This is a problem only for <em>new source code</em>. The situation for existing binaries
    is quite a bit simpler. With a few exceptions, plug-in binaries built with the pre-6.0 SDK
    will run in LightWave 6.0 but won't have access to any of the new features. Binaries built
    with the current SDK will <em>not</em> run in versions of LightWave prior to 6.0.)</p>
    <p>With 6.0, the API doubled in size, and in keeping with the complete overhaul of
    LightWave itself, many familiar API structures were renamed, rearranged or removed. It's
    no longer possible to write plug-ins to both the current and 5.x APIs using the same code
    base and a single set of SDK headers. In some cases it simply won't make sense to continue
    to work within the limitations of the 5.x SDK, particularly as time passes and older
    versions of LightWave fade from view. But with that caveat in mind, it's still possible to
    write a single plug-in that uses new SDK features yet runs in LightWave 5.x.</p>
    <p>One way to do this is to segregate any code that requires a particular API version.
    Your <a href="server.html#actfunc">activation functions</a> might look like the following.</p>
    <pre>   XCALL_( static int )
   Activate( long version, GlobalFunc *global, void *local,
      void *serverData )
   {
      unsigned long prodinfo, major;

      prodinfo = ( unsigned long ) global( LWPRODUCTINFO_GLOBAL,
         GFUSE_TRANSIENT );
      major = LWINF_GETMAJOR( prodinfo );
      if ( major &lt; 6 )
         return Activate5( version, global, local, serverData );
      else
         return Activate6( version, global, local, serverData );
   }</pre>
    <p>The <a href="globals/prodinfo.html">Product Info</a> global is used here to distinguish
    between major versions of LightWave. <tt>Activate5</tt> is the activation function you
    would have written, had this been an exclusively 5.x plug-in, and <tt>Activate6</tt> is
    the 6.0 version. <tt>Activate</tt> covers both functions and is the activation function
    that should be listed in the ServerRecord. <tt>Activate5</tt> and <tt>Activate6</tt>
    reside in two different .c files, each of which includes the appropriate version of the
    headers and contains the version-sensitive callbacks. The code that doesn't depend on the
    API version can be called from both of these files.</p>
    <p>In the 6 SDK, the ServerRecord structure was extended to include a <tt>tagInfo</tt>
    member, and the value of the <tt>sysVersion</tt> member of the ModuleDescriptor structure
    was incremented. (These structures are defined in <a href="../include/lwserver.h">lwserver.h</a>
    and <a href="../include/lwmodule.h">lwmodule.h</a> in the 6.0 SDK, and in splug.h and
    serv_w.c in the 5.x SDK.) The change in <tt>sysVersion</tt> prevents plug-ins linked with
    the 6 SDK library from being loaded by earlier versions of LightWave that don't know about
    <tt>tagInfo</tt>. Your 5.x/6 hybrid plug-in must therefore be linked with the 5.x SDK
    library, and it can't include <tt>tagInfo</tt> in its ServerRecords.</p>
    <p><strong>Product Info and System ID</strong></p>
    <p>The <a href="globals/prodinfo.html">Product Info</a> global returns the identity of the
    host (e.g. LightWave), its major and minor version numbers, and the build number. The <a
    href="globals/sysid.html">System ID</a> global tells you which specific program you're
    running in (e.g., Layout, Modeler or Screamernet). If your plug-in uses features that only
    appear in certain versions of LightWave, or in LightWave but not in other programs that
    may share the LightWave SDK, or in Layout but not Modeler, you can use these two globals
    so that you can either bracket the affected code or fail gracefully.</p>
    <p>Note that this is only necessary when the class version number or the global service
    name aren't sufficient by themselves to ensure compatibility, as in the 5.x example above.
    The need also arises in cases where the LightWave programmers, proving they are only
    human, forget to increment a version number when they make a change to a header.</p>
    <p>Returning to our shader example, LightWave 7.0 added four fields to the LWShaderAccess
    structure without a corresponding change to <tt>LWSHADER_VERSION</tt>. As the History
    section of the shader page points out, you'll need to use the Product Info global to
    ensure that you're running in at least LightWave 7.0 before you try to read or write those
    new LWShaderAccess fields.</p>
    <p>The least convenient but most reliable version indicator is the build number. You may
    occasionally need this in order to identify minor patches that retain the same major and
    minor version numbers. Older versions of a given LightWave component will always have
    smaller build numbers, so that you can reliably use inequalities to test whether the
    current program is <em>at least as</em> old or new as a specific build. The build numbers
    for LightWave Layout and Modeler are displayed in their About boxes.</p>
    <p><strong>Platforms</strong></p>
    <p>LightWave is available on more than one operating system. You can build a version of
    your plug-in for each of these operating systems and platforms without the use of any
    platform-specific source code. LightWave supports this by providing services for <a
    href="fileio.html">file I/O</a> and user interface construction (<a
    href="globals/panel.html">panels</a>, <a href="globals/xpanel.html">xpanels</a>, <a
    href="globals/modreq.html">requesters</a>, <a href="globals/message.html">messages</a>, <a
    href="globals/filereq2.html">file dialogs</a>, <a href="globals/colorpik.html">color
    dialogs</a>, <a href="globals/preview.html">previews</a>, <a href="globals/shelf.html">presets</a>
    and <a href="globals/modmon.html">monitors</a>, for example) that hide details specific to
    each platform. You just need to recompile.</p>
    <p>The SDK requires you to define certain preprocessor symbols to distinguish between
    platforms. The <a href="../include/lwdisplay.h">lwdisplay.h</a> header uses these, for
    example, to selectively compile different versions of the structure returned by the <a
    href="globals/display.html">Host Display Info</a> global. Under Windows, your plug-in
    receives an HWND for the LightWave component's main window, while on the Mac, it receives
    a WindowPtr. Which one you get will depend on whether you define <tt>_WIN32</tt> or <tt>_MACOS</tt>
    when you compile.</p>
    <p>Although platform independence is usually a good thing, the SDK by no means requires
    it. Plug-ins aren't exotic objects on any platform. They're shared libraries on the Mac
    and DLLs in Windows, and they can do everything that other dynamically linked code can do
    on those platforms.</p>
    <p>Under Windows, your plug-in can include an entry point function, usually called <tt>DllMain</tt>.
    The entry point is a function Windows calls when LightWave loads your plug-in (or when any
    process or thread links to a DLL). In order to gain access to resources (dialog box
    templates, bitmaps, icons, version data) you've linked into your .p file, you need to know
    your module handle, which you receive as the first argument to your entry point function.</p>
    <pre>   #ifdef _WIN32
   static HINSTANCE hdll;

   BOOL WINAPI DllMain( HINSTANCE hInstance, ULONG reason,
      LPVOID reserved )
   {
      if ( reason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH )
         hdll = hInstance;
      return TRUE;
   }
   #endif /* _WIN32 */</pre>
    <p>Later, you can pass <tt>hdll</tt> as the first argument to Win32 functions like <tt>LoadIcon</tt>
    and <tt>DialogBox</tt>.</p>
    <p><strong>Parting Tips</strong><ul>
      <li>Always check the activation version (the first argument to the <a
        href="server.html#actfunc">activation function</a>).</li>
      <li>Always check the value returned by the <a href="globals.html">global function</a>. It
        may be NULL if the global you've requested doesn't exist in the LightWave that's running
        you.</li>
      <li>You can use the <tt>lookup</tt> function to see whether a <a href="commands.html">command</a>
        is available.</li>
      <li>Write to the spec. Don't make assumptions about undocumented LightWave internals. Don't
        try to dereference opaque pointers or read past the ends of buffers, and don't rely on
        buffers being contiguous or persistent, or in the same form internally as they are in the
        SDK.</li>
      <li>When possible, follow LightWave conventions.</li>
      <li>Use the <a href="globals/prodinfo.html">Product Info</a> and <a href="sysid.html">System
        ID</a> globals to find out what program is calling you.</li>
      <li>Use platform-independent services for file I/O and user interfaces.</li>
    </ul>
