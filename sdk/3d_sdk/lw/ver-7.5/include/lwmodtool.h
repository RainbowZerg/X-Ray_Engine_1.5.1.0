/*
 * The MeshEdit tool is a LightWave viewport tool that performs its
 * action through a MeshEditOp.  The extra functions are:
 *
 * test         return a code for the edit action that needs to be
 *              performed.  Actions given below.
 *
 * build        perform the mesh edit operation to reflect the current
 *              tool settings.
 *
 * end          clear the state when the last edit action is completed.
 *              This can be a result of the 'test' update code or it can
 *              be triggered by an external action.
