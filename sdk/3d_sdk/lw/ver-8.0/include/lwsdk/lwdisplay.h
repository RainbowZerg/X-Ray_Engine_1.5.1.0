 * LWDISPLAY.H -- LightWave Host Display Info
 *
 * The host application provides a variety of services for getting user
 * input, but if all else fails the plug-in may need to open windows.
 * Since it runs in the host's context, it needs to get the host's display
 * information to do this.  This info, which can be normally accessed
 * with the "Host Display Info" global service, contains information about
 * the windows and display context used by the host.  If this ID yeilds a
 * null pointer, the server is probably running in a batch mode and has no
 * display context.
