 * In BINARY mode, the external form contains raw bytes having any
 * value from 0 to 255.  Reads and writes are entirely based on the
 * number of bytes requested.
 *
 * In ASCII mode, all data bytes must be in the extended ASCII range
 * of 32 to 255.  Values outside this range are ignored or undefined.

/*
 * This structure is used when the server is writing its state to
 * the external store.  The 'writeData' is the first argument to all
 * the callback functions.
 *
 * write	execute a raw write to the store.  In BINARY mode, the
 *		number of bytes indicated by 'len' is written directly to 
 *		the output.  In ASCII mode the input buffer is treated as 
 *		a null-terminated string and the length is computed from 
 *		that.  The string is written with a newline at the end.
 *
 * writeI1	write an array of different sized and typed integers to
 * writeI2	the store.  In BINARY mode the 'n' numbers are written as
 * writeI4	1, 2 or 4 btype elements in "big-endian" (Motorola) 
 * writeU1	format.  In ASCII mode, all 'n' numbers are written to a 
 * writeU2	single line, the signed values in decimal and the unsigned 
 * writeU4	values in hexadecimal.  A newline is written after the 
 *		list of numbers unless the writing is done inside a leaf
 *		block.
 *
 * writeStr	write a null-terminated string to the store.  In ASCII
 *		mode the string may be contained in double quotes.
 *
 * writeID	write an identifier token to the store.  In BINARY mode
 *		this is the four-byte ID code, while in ASCII mode this
 *		is the string token.
 *
 * beginBlk	start a nested data block.  The block is identified by
 *		the ID codes defined in the LWBlockIdent, and the 'leaf'
 *		flag is true if this block will not contain other blocks.
 *
 * endBlk	end the current data block.
 *
 * depth	return the current block nesting level, where zero means
 *		we've entered no blocks.

 * This structure is used when the server is reading its state from

 *
 * read		execute a raw read of the store.  In binary mode, 'len'
 *		bytes are read directly from the store.  In ASCII mode,	up 
 *		to 'len' bytes of the current line are read from the 
 *		store, perhaps leaving more bytes to be read later.  The
 *		return value is the number of bytes read on the current
 *		line (which may be zero), or -1 for end of data.
 *
 * readI1	read an array of integers of various types and formats,
 * readI2	returning the number of integers successfully read.  In
 * readI4	BINARY mode a sequence of 'n' single, double or quad bytes
 * readU1	are read from the stream and interpreted as "big-endian"
 * readU2	(Motorola) format words.  In ASCII mode, the numbers are
 * readU4	read from the current line, in decimal for signed values 
 *		and in hexadecimal for unsigned values.
 *
 * readFP	read an array of floating point numbers from the store.
 *		The return value is the number of values read.
 *
 * readStr	read a string from the store.  In ASCII mode double quotes
 *		will be removed.
 *
 * readID	read an identifier token from the store.  In BINARY this is
 *		just a four-byte code value, but in ASCII this in the string
 *		token which will be matched with its longword code.
 *
 * findBlk	read ahead looking for the next block.  The array of block
 *		identifiers includes all the blocks that could be expected
 *		and is terminated with a null ID code.  If a reconginized
 *		block is found in the file, it's ID code is returned.  A
 *		zero return indicates no more valid blocks.
 *
 * endBlk	complete reading the current open block.
 *
 * depth	return the current block nesting level, where zero means
 *		we've entered no blocks.
